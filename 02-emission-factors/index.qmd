## Overview {.unnumbered}

This chapter provides a comprehensive technical reference for selecting and applying Tier 1 emission factors under the ART-TREES 2.0 standard. Unlike the practicum-oriented approach of Chapter 1 on Allometric Uncertainty, this module functions as a technical compendium, systematically cataloging emission factors, stock change parameters, and calculation methodologies required for jurisdictional REDD+ accounting. The guidance emphasizes strategic application of IPCC 2019 Refinement data to identify high-value carbon crediting opportunities while maintaining technical rigor and audit defensibility.

These methodological refinements are critical for uncertainty reduction because they allow programs to substitute high-uncertainty assumptions with empirically-grounded parameters. Under the 2006 Guidelines, many land-use transitions—particularly those involving soil carbon dynamics—required either highly conservative default values or costly Tier 3 field measurements. The 2019 Refinements provide a robust middle path: Tier 1 defaults that are stratified by climate, soil type, and management intensity, reducing the coefficient of variation for key emission factors while maintaining audit defensibility. For example, the expanded grassland management factors (F_MG) enable programs to differentiate improved versus degraded pasture conditions using observable management criteria rather than relying on generic "grassland" assumptions with uncertainty ranges exceeding ±50%. Similarly, the 20-year SOC transition period aligns accounting timelines with actual biogeochemical processes, eliminating the artificial spike in uncertainty that occurred when programs attempted to model instantaneous soil carbon losses across heterogeneous landscapes.

By systematically ranking emission factors by their uncertainty contributions and selecting land-use activities with well-parameterized defaults, programs can achieve two simultaneous objectives: (1) reduce the overall uncertainty propagated through Monte Carlo simulations, thereby decreasing the confidence deduction applied to final credit issuance, and (2) prioritize activities where carbon gains are both substantial and defensible under audit scrutiny.

In this chapter, project developers will learn not only how to calculate emissions correctly, but how to strategically select management scenarios that maximize carbon benefits within political and landscape constraints. By completing this module, trainees will be able to:

-   Distinguish between mineral soil stock-difference and organic soil flux-based accounting methodologies
-   Select appropriate emission factors based on land use transitions, climate zones, and management practices
-   Apply IPCC Tier 1 default values with correct stratification by soil type, agroecological zone, climate, and seasonality.
-   Identify carbon crediting opportunities through improved land management scenarios
-   Calculate soil organic carbon (SOC) and above-ground biomass (AGB) changes using standardized equations
-   Implement safeguards against double-counting throughout all temporal and spatial domains.\*\*

## 2.1 IPCC Refinements & Strategic Opportunities

The 2019 IPCC Refinements introduced specific technical enhancements that expand the toolkit available to program developers:

-   20-year SOC transition period: Replaces instantaneous oxidation assumptions with gradual stock-change dynamics, enabling credit streams distributed over project duration rather than front-loaded at land-use conversion
-   Enhanced grassland management factors: Improved tropical grasslands (F_MG = 1.17) versus degraded (F_MG = 0.70) creates approximately 67% SOC gain potential when transitioning from degraded to improved management
-   Expanded agroforestry parameterization: System-specific growth rates (G = 2.37-6.24 tC/ha/yr) differentiate silvopasture, silvoarable, and multistrata systems with empirical backing
-   Age-stratified forest regrowth: Young secondary forests (≤20 years) show 2-3× higher annual biomass accumulation rates than mature stands, allowing programs to optimize restoration timing

In practical terms, projects focused on landscape restoration, improved pasture management, and agroforestry integration can now access higher default values with stronger technical justification and highly attractive rates of annual carbon gains. \*\*This chapter focuses on understanding these emission factors as fundamental building blocks of carbon accounting, examining how uncertainty propagates through the system, and developing procedures to identify high-impact opportunities for uncertainty reduction that align with program objectives.

### Tier 1 Emission Factors {.unnumbered}

In terms of ART-TREES jurisdictional carbon offset reporting, programs must correctly distinguish between two fundamentally different accounting approaches based on soil type:

Table 2.A: Comparison of Mineral vs. Organic Soil Carbon Stock Reporting

| Criteria | Mineral Soils | Organic Soils |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| Soil Types | Cropland, Grassland, Forest on mineral substrates | Peatlands, Wetlands, Histosols (\>12-20% OC) |
| Primary Driver | Land use change (discrete conversion event) | Drainage status (continuous hydrological process) |
| Carbon Dynamics | Assumed moving to steady-state over period | Oxidizes continually if drained unless re-wetted |
| Accounting Method | Stock-Difference: ΔC = (SOC₀ − SOC₀₋ₜ) / D | Flux-Based: Annual = EF × Area |
| Time Horizon | 20-year transition period (IPCC default) | Perpetual emissions until water table restored |
| Credit Mechanism | Sequestration through enhanced inputs | Avoidance through drainage cessation |
| Key Parameters | Stock change factors (F~LU~, F~MG~, F~I~) | Direct emission factors (tCO₂/ha/yr) |
| IPCC Source | 2019 Vol. 4, Ch. 2, 5, 6 | 2013 Wetlands Supplement, Ch. 2 |

### Tier 1 Crediting Opportunities {.unnumbered}

The 2019 Refinements provide improved quantification for several land management transitions with significant carbon credit potential:

Table 2.B: Strategic Opportunities for Carbon Credit Generation

| Activity Type | IPCC 2019 Advantage | Key Factor | Material Potential |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Grassland Restoration | New management factors reward sustainable grazing + improvements | F~MG~ = 1.17 (improved) vs. 0.70 (degraded) | \~67% SOC recovery over 20 years |
| Silvoarable Agroforestry | Highest documented biomass accumulation rate | G = 6.24 tC/ha/yr | 28.8 tCO₂e/ha/yr (AGB+BGB) |
| Young Secondary Forest Protection | Age-stratified growth rates emphasize rapid early accumulation | G = 5.9 t DM/ha/yr (Americas, ≤20 yr) | 10.8 tCO₂e/ha/yr |
| Conservation Agriculture | Multiplicative effect of no-till + high inputs | F~MG~ × F~I~ = 1.10 × 1.11 | 22% SOC retention vs. conventional |
| Multistrata Coffee/Cacao | Dual revenue from carbon credits + commodity production | G = 3.25 tC/ha/yr + SOC gains | Combined above/belowground benefits |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.2 Belowground Stock Change

#### Stock-Difference Method {.unnumbered}

The latest IPCC Tier 1 method requires calculating annual loss in SOC of mineral soils using a linear decay model that is distributed over a default transition period of 20 years. This replaces the 2006 assumption of immediate 100% SOC oxidation. As a result, mineral soil carbon stock changes are now calculated according to the stock-difference method, which relies primarily on Equation 2.25 [@ipccChapter2Generic2019, p.33]:

$\Delta C_{Mineral} = \frac{(SOC_0 - SOC_{(0-T)})}{D} \times Area$

Where:

-   ΔC~Mineral~ = Annual change in organic C stocks (tonnes C/yr)
-   SOC₀ = Soil organic C stock in final year of transition period (tonnes C/ha)
-   SOC~(0-T)~ = Soil organic C stock at beginning of inventory period (tonnes C/ha)
-   D = Time dependence of stock change factors (default: 20 years)
-   Area = Land area of stratum (hectares)

#### Stock Difference Computation

For each SOC inventory period, an initial and and final value of carbon is computed using stock change factors estimated for the region and general growing conditions, as defined in Eq2.25b below:

$SOC = SOC_{REF} \times F_{LU} \times F_{MG} \times F_I$

Where:

-   SOC~REF~ = Reference C stocks under native vegetation (tC/ha) \[Table 2.3\]
-   F~LU~ = Land use stock change factor (dimensionless) \[Climate/land use specific\]
-   F~MG~ = Management stock change factor (dimensionless) \[Practice-specific\]
-   F~I~ = Input stock change factor (dimensionless) \[Organic amendment level\]

## SOC Depth Assumptions

IPCC Tier 1 SOC emission factors assume 0-30 cm soil depth only (SOC~30~). Deeper soil disturbances and greater depth variance require Tier 2/3 approaches with site-specific measurements of ≥100 cm depth (SOC~100~). These data constraints in the IPCC SOC~REF~ values are discussed in Batjes' synthesis work, including:

-   Batjes @batjes2009ipcc *IPCC Default Soil Classes from HWSD*: taxotransfer reclassification of FAO data into soil parent groups (HAC, LAC, SAN, POD, VOL, WET, ORG) combining European Soil Database, China Soil Map, SOTER/WISE, FAO's Digital Soil Map and supplementary data
-   Batjes @batjes2010global - A *global framework of soil organic carbon stocks under native vegetation for use with the simple assessment option of the Carbon Benefits Project system.* Carbon Benefits Project (CBP) and ISRIC–World Soil Information. Wageningen
-   Batjes @batjes2011soil - *Soil Organic Carbon Stocks Under Native Vegetation*: Derived using ISRIC-WISE database combining \~10,250 soil profiles globally, filtering to \~5020 suitable profiles, removing outliers and calculating mean estimates per climate-soil cluster.

Key Findings:

-   "Average SOC stocks to 30 cm presented here are lower than those listed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.
-   "Average SOC stocks, to the IPCC depth of 30cm, vary greatly within each functional group, with coefficients of variation range from 22% to 106%, with an average CV of 59%. The estimated default relative error of ±90% assumed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines is too conservative" (Batjes, 201).
-   SOC data are right-skewed and mean-derived, allowing fewer extremely large outliers inflate the mean above the median (Batjes, 2010, p.14; Batjes, 2011, p.371).

Documented Cases:

-   German Alps forest soils (Wiesmeier et al., 2014): Mean = 10.9 kg C/m², Median = 7.2 kg C/m² (34% difference)
-   German agricultural soils (Vos et al., 2018): Highly skewed iPOM distributions with outliers driving means upward

Geographic Bias: Warm-temperate moist (W1) values elevated 15-25% due to disproportionate Brazilian sampling in WISE database, exercise caution applying to Andean/Chaco/Patagonian contexts.

### South America Bias

1.  Depth Underestimation (30-70% error)

    The 30 cm limit may substantially underestimate emissions from deep disturbances. As Batjes (2010, p.21) notes, "The potential impact of land use change on SOC~30~ stocks, vis-à-vis SOC stocks to 100 cm depth (SOC~100~), may vary markedly according to IPCC climate zone and soil class."

    As a result, this carries higher audit risk particularly around Andean road construction, reclaimed mining lands, mechanized agriculture on deep Andosols.

2.  Regional Sampling Gaps:

    1.  High-Andean páramo: \<50 profiles in WISE database
    2.  Patagonian steppe: Underrepresented relative to area
    3.  Chaco dry forests: Sparse coverage, dominated by Argentine samples
    4.  Amazon deep soils: Most profiles limited to 0-30cm

3.  Volcanic Soil Under-representation

    Single "VOL" class with ±27-90% uncertainty represents the highest of all factors, which lumps all young ash soils, weathered Andosols, and paleosols with 3-5 times greater variance. Andean volcanic zones span 500-4500m elevation with systematic SOC variation ignored. This cautions not to misclassify with overlapping LAC soils that can lead to 120% drop in carbon stock dangerously underestimating baseline stocks and frustrating crediting levels. In these sites, consider prioritizing Tier 2 using national surveys.

4.  Climate Reference Period (1985-2015)

    IPCC climate zones based on 30-year normals do not capture post-2000 changes, including Andean glacier retreats, cloud forest elevation migrations, and rainfall declines in Páramo

5.  Polygon Aggregation Ignores Variability

    HWSD uses uniform values per map unit. Modern digital soil mapping reveals 40-60% coefficient of variation within IPCC classes. Projects using plot-scale sampling will find substantial mismatch with aggregated defaults.

### 2019 Refinements Status

Tier 1 Improvements:

-   Stock change factors (F~LU~, F~MG~, F~I~),
-   Agroforestry parameters (Cardinael et al., 2018),
-   20-year transition formalized (stock-difference), improved organic soil emission factors (Flux Method).

Tier 1 Unchanged:

-   SOC~REF~ values (still based on WISE database)
-   Arithmetic mean approach (medians not adopted
-   Geographic sampling bias (no rebalancing) - 0-30 cm depth standard

Cost-Effective Approach: Use SoilGrids250m validated with stratified field sampling (n=30-50 profiles per climate-soil zone) to develop project-specific SOC~REF~ distributions.

## 2.3 Grassland Management Factors

Grassland systems are stratified by management intensity and input levels, with separate factors for tropical versus temperate boreal zones.

#### Management Factor (F~MG~) {.unnumbered}

Table 2.C: Grassland Management Stock Change Factors (IPCC 2019, Vol. 4, Ch. 6, [Table 6.4](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_06_Ch6_Grassland.pdf#page=27))

| Management Status | Description | F~MG~ | Uncertainty | Climate |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Nominal/Native | Low to medium intensity grazing; periodic cutting; no significant management improvements | 1.00 | NA (ref) | All climates |
| High Intensity Grazing | Shifts in vegetation composition and structure; NOT severely degraded; sustainable stocking rates maintained | 0.90 | ±8% | All climates |
| Severely Degraded | Major long-term productivity loss; severe soil erosion; extensive bare soil patches; structural damage | 0.70 | ±40% | All climates |
| Improved Grassland | Sustainable management (light/moderate grazing) PLUS ≥1 improvement: fertilization, species improvement, OR irrigation | 1.14 | ±11% | Temperate/Boreal |
| Improved Grassland | Sustainable management (light/moderate grazing) PLUS ≥1 improvement: fertilization, species improvement, OR irrigation | 1.17 | ±9% | Tropical (All moisture classes) |
| Improved Grassland | Sustainable management (light/moderate grazing) PLUS ≥1 improvement: fertilization, species improvement, OR irrigation | 1.16 | ±40% | Tropical Montane |

::: callout-important
## Important Operational Definitions:

-   Definition of "Improved land" requires classification of BOTH sustainable grazing intensity and at least one documented improvement practice (*`cite`*)
-   High intensity grazing (F~MG~ = 0.90) represents moderate degradation with vegetation change but not presenting severe overgrazing and downstream erosion
-   Severely degraded (F~MG~ = 0.70) is reserved for category of lands showing major structural damage, active erosion, and substantial productivity loss. This class provides maximum restoration credit potential.
:::

#### Input Factor (F~I~) {.unnumbered}

Table 2.D: Input Stock Change Factors for Improved Grasslands (*IPCC 2019, Ch. 6, [Table 6.2](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_06_Ch6_Grassland.pdf#page=27))*

| Input Level | Description | F~I~ | Uncertainty | Application |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Medium | Baseline improved grassland; no *additional* inputs beyond the single improvement that qualifies the system as "improved" | 1.00 | NA (ref) | Default for F~MG~ = 1.14-1.17 |
| High | Improved grassland receiving one or more additional management inputs/improvements beyond baseline | 1.11 | ±7% | Multiple concurrent improvements |

::: callout-warning
## Critical Distinction

The F~I~ = 1.11 factor applies to additional improvements beyond the initial one that qualified the grassland as "improved."

-   Example 1: Light grazing + fertilization → F~MG~ = 1.17, F~I~ = 1.00
-   Example 2: Light grazing + fertilization + irrigation → F~MG~ = 1.17, F~I~ = 1.11

Do not apply F~I~ = 1.11 to the single improvement used to justify F~MG~ = 1.17.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.4 Cropland Management Factors

Cropland accounting requires stratification by tillage system (F~LU~), tillage intensity (F~MG~), and organic input level (F~I~).

#### Land Use Factor (F~LU~)

Table 2.E: Cropland Land Use Stock Change Factors *PCC 2019, Vol. 4, Ch. 5, [Table 5.5](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/pdf/4_Volume4/19R_V4_Ch05_Cropland.pdf#page=27)))*

| Tillage System | Description | F~LU~ | Climate Zone | Application |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Long-term Cultivated | Continuous annual crops \>20 years | 0.69 | Tropical Moist | Baseline degraded state |
| Long-term Cultivated | Continuous annual crops \>20 years | 0.80 | Tropical Montane | Baseline degraded state |
| Long-term Cultivated | Continuous annual crops \>20 years | 0.92 | Tropical Dry | Baseline degraded state |
| Set Aside | Temporary idle cropland or conservation reserve (\<20 years) | 0.93 | Tropical Moist | Recovering/fallow lands |
| Paddy Rice | Long-term annual wetland cropping | 1.35 | All Tropical | Anaerobic SOC preservation |

::: callout-tip
## SOC Baseline Strategies

The F~LU~ = 0.69 factor for long-term cultivated tropical moist croplands represents substantial SOC depletion, providing a favorable baseline for conservation agriculture interventions.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table 2.F: Cropland Tillage Intensity Stock Change Factors (*IPCC 2019, Vol. 4, Ch. 5, [Table 5.5](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/pdf/4_Volume4/19R_V4_Ch05_Cropland.pdf#page=27))*

| Tillage Practice | Description | F~MG~ | Climate Zone | Materiality (Ref Value) |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Full Tillage | Substantial soil disturbance; \>30% surface bare after planting; moldboard/disc plowing | 1.00 | All climates | no benefit |
| Reduced Tillage | Primary and/or secondary tillage before planting; \<30% residue remaining on surface | 0.99 | Tropical Dry | Minimal benefit |
| Reduced Tillage | Primary and/or secondary tillage before planting; \<30% residue remaining on surface | 1.02 | Tropical Montane | Slight SOC gain |
| Reduced Tillage | Primary and/or secondary tillage before planting; \<30% residue remaining on surface | 1.04 | Tropical Moist/Wet | Moderate SOC gain |
| No-Till | Direct seeding; minimal disturbance; \>30% residue cover maintained | 1.04 | Tropical Dry | Moderate benefit |
| No-Till | Direct seeding; minimal disturbance; \>30% residue cover maintained | 1.07 | Tropical Montane | Strong benefit |
| No-Till | Direct seeding; minimal disturbance; \>30% residue cover maintained | 1.10 | Tropical Moist/Wet | Maximum benefit |

::: callout-tip
## Management Strategies (F~MG~)

No-till systems in Tropical Moist climates provide a 10% SOC increase (F~MG~ = 1.10) over full tillage. This factor is multiplicative with input factors, potentially offsetting SOC losses from forest conversion when combined with high organic inputs (1.10 × 1.11 = 1.22).
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.5 Example Tier 1 Strategy

Input factors apply to both cropland and improved grassland systems, stratified by level of organic matter additions.

Table 2.F: Organic Input Stock Change Factors (*IPCC 2019, Vol. 4, Ch. 5, [Table 5.5](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/pdf/4_Volume4/19R_V4_Ch05_Cropland.pdf#page=27))*

| Input Level | Description | F~I~ | Uncertainty | Examples |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Low | Residue removal OR bare fallowing OR no N-fixing crops | 0.92 | ±30% | Export all straw/stover; burn residues |
| Medium | All residues returned to field OR supplemental organic matter added | 1.00 | NA (reference) | Standard practice; residue retention |
| High (without manure) | High residue crops + green manures + cover crops | 1.04 | ±30% | Intensive cover cropping; legume rotations |
| High (with manure) | High inputs PLUS regular animal manure application | 1.11 | ±30% | Maximum SOC gain |

#### Multiplicative Effect:

Consider forest conversion to conservation agriculture in Tropical Moist climate:

```         
Scenario: Forest → No-till cropland + high inputs + manure

Initial SOC: 38 tC/ha (LAC soil, native forest)
  F_LU = 1.0, F_MG = 1.0, F_I = 1.0
  SOC_initial = 38 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 38.0 tC/ha

Final SOC: 
  F_LU = 0.83 (long-term cultivated), F_MG = 1.10 (no-till), F_I = 1.11 (high+manure)
  SOC_final = 38 × 0.83 × 1.10 × 1.11 = 38.4 tC/ha

Result: SLIGHT NET GAIN despite forest conversion
Annual change: (38.4 - 38.0) / 20 = +0.02 tC/ha/yr (negligible)
```

This demonstrates how strategic management can approach carbon neutrality for necessary agricultural expansion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.6 Reference Stock Values

Reference stocks (SOC~REF~) represent soil organic carbon content under native vegetation, stratified by climate zone and soil type. For example, the following default pre-conversion soil conditions are estimated for the following soil types in Tropical Montane ecozones, reporting mean stock volumes and their associated uncertainty metrics.

Table 2.G: Reference SOC Stocks, Tropical Montane (*IPCC 2019, Vol. 4, Ch. 2, [Table 2.3](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/pdf/4_Volume4/19R_V4_Ch02_Generic%20Methods.pdf#page=35)*)

| Soil Type | SOC~REF~ (tC/ha) | Uncertainty | Typical Locations |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| High Activity Clay (HAC) | 51 | ±10% | Montane valleys; moderate weathering; base-rich parent material |
| Low Activity Clay (LAC) | 44 | ±11% | Older highly weathered montane soils; kaolinitic clays |
| Sandy (SAN) | 52 | ±34% | Alluvial terraces (uncommon in mountains) |
| Volcanic (VOL) | 96 | ±31% | Andean volcanic zones—highest SOC potential |
| Wetland Organic (WET) | 82 | ±50% | High-altitude peatlands; páramo wetlands |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Volcanic Soils

Volcanic soils (VOL) in Andean regions hold nearly double the carbon of other mineral soil types, prioritize protection of volcanic soil landscapes for maximum carbon benefits.

::: callout-important
## Dry Tropics Strategies

Tropical dry zones have inherently low SOC baselines (19-21 tC/ha for mineral soils). Carbon credit generation in these regions should prioritize above-ground biomass through agroforestry and forest protection rather than soil carbon sequestration.

## 2.7. Aboveground Stock Change

### Agroforestry Systems {.unnumbered}

Agroforestry represents a high-value opportunity for carbon crediting, combining productive land use with significant biomass accumulation. The IPCC 2019 Refinements provide system-specific growth rates for seven distinct agroforestry typologies.

Table 2.K: Agroforestry System Typology *(IPCC 2019, Vol. 4, Ch. 5, Table 5.4)*

| System | Definition | Tree Component | Crop/Livestock Component |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Silvoarable | Trees integrated with annual crop production in spatial mixture | Regularly spaced rows or scattered; 20-1,000 stems/ha; managed for timber/fruit | Cereals, legumes, vegetables in rotation |
| Silvopasture | Trees integrated with livestock grazing | Scattered individuals or clusters; 150-2,000 stems/ha; shade and fodder provision | Grasses, improved pasture species |
| Alley Cropping | Dense tree rows with annual crops planted in alleys between hedgerows | Dense hedgerows; \~8,500 stems/ha; regular pruning for biomass/mulch | Annual crops in rotation between tree rows |
| Multistrata | Vertical stratification of tree species (≥2 canopy layers) | Mixed species at different canopy heights; \~900 stems/ha | Shade-tolerant perennials (coffee, cacao, spices) |
| Shaded Perennial | Single-story tree canopy over perennial crop | Uniform overstory; \~4,200 stems/ha; managed for consistent shade | Coffee, tea, cacao as understory |
| Fallow (Rotational) | Woody vegetation regrowth phase in shifting cultivation systems | Dense natural regeneration; \~6,000 stems/ha during fallow | Crops planted after clearing fallow vegetation |
| Parkland | Scattered mature trees retained in extensive cropland | Very sparse; \~150 stems/ha; remnant trees from forest conversion | Extensive annual crop systems |

#### Stock Accumulation Rates {.unnumbered}

## Cost-Benefit Metrics

Note that accumulation rates carry ±15-63% uncertainty in their distribution which represents useful ROI benchmark for investment decisions and crediting management.
:::

### Silvopastoral Systems {.unnumbered}

1.  Silvoarable systems offer the highest long-term carbon accumulation (7.86 tC/ha/yr), equivalent to 28.8 tCO₂e/ha/yr—ideal for jurisdictions with strong silvicultural capacity

2.  Fallow systems have rapid accumulation rates (4.42 tC/ha/yr) but short harvest cycles (5 years)—useful for bridging short-term credit gaps but require frequent re-establishment

3.  Multistrata coffee/cacao (3.25 tC/ha/yr) balances commodity production with carbon credits, making it economically attractive where markets exist

4.  Below-ground accumulation adds 21-27% to total carbon gains—always include root biomass in credit calculations

#### CO₂e Conversion: {.unnumbered}

``` bash

Total C Gain (tC/ha/yr) × 3.67 = tCO₂e/ha/yr

## Mixed vs. Monoculture Tree Cropping

Shaded coffee/cacao (Multistrata system: 3.25 tC/ha/yr) accumulates 3.6× more carbon than unshaded monocultures (\~0.9 tC/ha/yr). This provides strong economic incentive for agroforestry adoption in suitable climates.

## 2.8 Post-Clearance Stock Retention

When forest is converted to perennial cropland, IPCC provides specific "Year 1" biomass retention values representing residual carbon after clearing but before full crop maturity.

Table 2.O: First-Year Biomass Stock After Forest Conversion (*IPCC 2019, Vol. 4, Ch. 5, Table 5.9)*

| Crop Type             | Climate          | Year-1 AGB (C~G~) | Source            |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|

::: callout-important
## One-Year Retention Limit

The C~G~ value represents biomass present in Year 1 only. Subsequent years accumulate at the growth rate G shown in Table 3.4 until reaching maximum stock at harvest cycle completion.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.9 Forest Stock Regrowth

Secondary forest regrowth rates are age-dependent, with young stands (≤20 years) showing substantially higher accumulation than mature forests (*`cite`*). This has critical implications for this module's objectives, to support project prioritization through strategic emission factor selections.

### Tropical Rainforest - Americas

Table 2.P: Secondary Rainforest Growth Rates (Americas) (*IPCC 2019, Vol. 4, Ch. 4, Table 4.9*)

| Age Class | Growth Rate (G) | Carbon Gain | Max Biomass | Strategic Application |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| ≤ 20 years | 5.9 t DM/ha/yr | 2.77 tC/ha/yr | 75.7 t DM/ha | Rapid regrowth phase—prioritize protection |
| \> 20 years | 2.3 t DM/ha/yr | 1.08 tC/ha/yr | 206.4 t DM/ha | Mature phase—lower annual credits |

Conversion Factors: - Carbon (tC) = Dry Matter (t DM) × 0.47 - CO₂ equivalent = Carbon × 3.67

Example: Young secondary forest (Americas, ≤20 yr)

```         
2.77 tC/ha/yr × 3.67 = 10.2 tCO₂e/ha/yr
```

::: callout-tip
## Age-Class Strategies

Young secondary forests (≤20 years) grow 2-3× faster than mature stands across all forest types. This means that protection or restoration projects targeting 0-20 year regeneration areas generate maximum credit velocity (annual tonnes CO₂e/ha). However, mature forests (\>20 years) hold larger carbon stocks and provide greater permanence security. Recommendation:

-   Portfolio approach combining both young regeneration (high annual credits) and mature forests (high stock, low leakage risk).

## 2.10 Worked Examples

### Example A: Tropical Moist Grassland Restoration {.unnumbered}

Scenario: Restore 1,000 ha of severely degraded tropical pasture to improved silvopasture with manure inputs

Step 1: Define Initial Conditions (Baseline)

-   Soil Type: Low Activity Clay (LAC)
-   Climate: Tropical Moist
-   SOC~REF~: 38 tC/ha (Table 2.7)
-   Management: Severely degraded (F~MG~ = 0.70)
-   Input Level: Nominal (F~I~ = 1.0)
-   Biomass: 7.6 t DM/ha (IPCC 2006 grassland default)

SOC Calculation (t=1):

```         
SOC_initial = SOC_REF × F_LU × F_MG × F_I
SOC_initial = 38 × 1.0 × 0.70 × 1.0
SOC_initial = 26.6 tC/ha
```

Step 2: Define Project Conditions (Final State)

-   Management: Improved tropical grassland (F~MG~ = 1.17)
-   Input Level: High with manure (F~I~ = 1.11)
-   Biomass: Silvopasture accumulation (G = 3.07 tC/ha/yr AGB + 0.84 tC/ha/yr BGB)

SOC Calculation (t=20):

```         
SOC_final = SOC_REF × F_LU × F_MG × F_I
SOC_final = 38 × 1.0 × 1.17 × 1.11
SOC_final = 49.3 tC/ha
```

Step 3: Calculate Annual SOC Change

```         
ΔSOC = (SOC_final - SOC_initial) / 20 years
ΔSOC = (49.3 - 26.6) / 20
ΔSOC = 1.14 tC/ha/yr
```

Step 4: Calculate Biomass Accumulation

```         
ΔBiomass (total) = G_AGB + G_BGB
ΔBiomass = 3.07 + 0.84
ΔBiomass = 3.91 tC/ha/yr
```

Step 5: Total Annual Carbon Benefit

```         
Total Gain = ΔSOC + ΔBiomass
Total Gain = 1.14 + 3.91
Total Gain = 5.05 tC/ha/yr

Convert to CO₂e:
Total Gain = 5.05 × 3.67 = 18.5 tCO₂e/ha/yr
```

Step 6: Project-Scale Credits Over 20 Years

```         
Total Credits (1,000 ha):
Per hectare: 5.05 tC/ha/yr × 20 yr = 101 tC/ha
Project total: 101 tC/ha × 1,000 ha = 101,000 tC
In CO₂e: 101,000 × 3.67 = 370,670 tCO₂e

Annual credits: 18,500 tCO₂e/yr
```

Revenue Potential (at \$15/tCO₂e): \$277,500 per year for 20 years

### Example B: Forest Conversion to Conservation Agriculture

Scenario: 500 ha of tropical moist forest converted to no-till annual cropland with high organic inputs (unavoidable conversion for food security)

Step 1: Initial Forest Biomass and SOC

-   Soil: LAC (SOC~REF~ = 38 tC/ha)
-   Biomass: 88 t DM/ha (IPCC default for tropical moist secondary forest)
-   Root:Shoot Ratio: 0.207 (Table 4.4)

Initial Carbon Stocks:

```         
AGB: 88 × 0.47 = 41.4 tC/ha
BGB: 41.4 × 0.207 = 8.6 tC/ha
SOC: 38 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 38.0 tC/ha
Total: 41.4 + 8.6 + 38.0 = 88.0 tC/ha
```

Step 2: Final Cropland Stocks

-   F~LU~: 0.83 (long-term cultivated)
-   F~MG~: 1.10 (no-till)
-   F~I~: 1.04 (high inputs, no manure)
-   Year-1 Biomass (C~G~): 4.7 tC/ha (Table 3.5)

Final SOC After 20 Years:

```         
SOC_final = 38 × 0.83 × 1.10 × 1.04
SOC_final = 37.1 tC/ha

Annual SOC change:
ΔSOC = (37.1 - 38.0) / 20 = -0.05 tC/ha/yr
```

Step 3: Biomass Loss Accounting

```         
Biomass lost in Year 1:
  AGB + BGB - C_G retained = (41.4 + 8.6) - 4.7 = 45.3 tC/ha

Convert to CO₂e:
  45.3 × 3.67 = 166 tCO₂e/ha (one-time loss)
```

Step 4: Total Carbon Impact

```         
Over 20 years:
  Biomass loss: -166 tCO₂e/ha (Year 1)
  SOC loss: -0.05 tC/ha/yr × 20 yr × 3.67 = -3.7 tCO₂e/ha
  
Total loss: 166 + 3.7 = 169.7 tCO₂e/ha

For 500 ha: 84,850 tCO₂e total
Annual average: 4,243 tCO₂e/yr
```

::: callout-important
With comprehensive uncertainty reporting strategies, conservation agriculture practices, characterized by no-till and high manure inputs, very nearly neutralizes SOC loss from forest conversion, representing only a \~0.18 tCO₂e/ha/yr decline across the inventory period. Biomass loss remains unavoidable, which clearly demonstrates the importance of:

1.  Applying and documenting maximum conservation practices when conversion is necessary
2.  Prioritizing conversion of already-degraded lands rather than forest
:::

### Example C: Young Secondary Forest Conservation {.unnumbered}

Scenario: Prevent clearing of 2,000 ha of 10-year-old secondary rainforest (Americas)

Step 1: Baseline (What Would Happen Without Project)

Assume conversion to severely degraded pasture:

```         
Biomass loss:
  Accumulated after 10 yr: 5.9 t DM/ha/yr × 10 yr = 59 t DM/ha
  Carbon: 59 × 0.47 = 27.7 tC/ha (AGB)
  Roots: 27.7 × 0.221 = 6.1 tC/ha (BGB)
  Total biomass: 33.8 tC/ha

SOC degradation (over 20 years):
  Initial: 38 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 38.0 tC/ha
  Final: 38 × 1.0 × 0.70 × 1.0 = 26.6 tC/ha
  Loss: (26.6 - 38.0) / 20 × 20 = 11.4 tC/ha

Total baseline loss: 33.8 + 11.4 = 45.2 tC/ha
In CO₂e: 45.2 × 3.67 = 166 tCO₂e/ha
```

Step 2: Project (Continued Growth Protected)

Forest continues growing for next 10 years (years 11-20):

```         
Additional biomass accumulation:
  AGB: 5.9 t DM/ha/yr × 10 yr × 0.47 = 27.7 tC/ha
  BGB: 27.7 × 0.221 = 6.1 tC/ha
  Total: 33.8 tC/ha

SOC maintained (no change): 0 tC/ha

Total project gain: 33.8 tC/ha
In CO₂e: 33.8 × 3.67 = 124 tCO₂e/ha
```

Step 3: Net Project Benefit

```         
Avoided emissions: 166 tCO₂e/ha
Additional sequestration: 124 tCO₂e/ha
Total credits: 290 tCO₂e/ha over 10-year crediting period

Annual average: 29 tCO₂e/ha/yr

For 2,000 ha:
  Total credits: 580,000 tCO₂e over 10 years
  Annual: 58,000 tCO₂e/yr
```

Revenue Potential (at \$12/tCO₂e): \$696,000 per year. Potentially, young secondary forests (≤20 years) provide exceptional credit generation as a result of:

-   High baseline threat of avoided deforestation scenario
-   Continued rapid growth rate of protected land at 5.9 t DM/ha/yr.
-   Additionality easily demonstrated such as in marginal lands otherwise targeted for clearing

This makes areas with 20 year regeneration rates prime candidates for Tier 1 reporting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.11 Double-Counting Risks

### Double-Counting SOC Timelines {.unnumbered}

-   Problem: Legacy emissions from historical land conversion overlap with new management activity credits
-   Rule: Each hectare reports in only one land category per reporting year

Safeguards:

1.  One Category Per Year: During 20-year SOC transition period, attribute ALL stock changes to the end-use land category, not the category of origin
2.  Cohort Tracking: Maintain records of conversion year for each hectare to calculate remaining transition period
3.  Overlapping Activities: When new management changes occur before transition completes:

Example:

```         
2015: Forest → Cropland (begins 20-year SOC transition)
2020: Apply improved management to same cropland

CORRECT approach:
  - Apply new factors only to remaining 15 years (2020-2035)
  - Calculate: (SOC_new_2035 - SOC_current_2020) / 15 years

INCORRECT approach:
  - Claim new full 20-year transition from 2020
  - This double-counts years 2020-2035 from original conversion
```

::: callout-warning
## Critical Rule

Consider reporting only non-CO₂ gases separately as CO₂ from biomass burning is already accounted for in the "Biomass Stock Change" calculation through the assumption of immediate oxidation in Tier 1 default for that transition type.
:::

### Tracking Site-Specific Timelines

-   Problem: Claiming infinite biomass accumulation in systems with periodic harvest
-   Rule: Agroforestry credits must account for harvest cycle and removal

Safeguards:

1.  Respect Default Harvest Cycles (Table 3.2):
    -   Tropical agroforestry: 20 years (except fallow: 5 years)
    -   Temperate agroforestry: 30 years
2.  Account for Biomass Removal at Harvest:

Example (Coffee Multistrata, 20-year cycle):

```         
Accumulation Phase (Years 1-20):
  Annual gain: 3.25 tC/ha/yr × 20 yr = 65 tC/ha accumulated

Harvest (Year 20):
  Biomass removal: L_mean = L_max / 2 = 65 / 2 = 32.5 tC/ha

Re-accumulation Phase (Years 21-40):
  Repeat accumulation: 3.25 tC/ha/yr × 20 yr = 65 tC/ha

Net Over 40 Years:
  Total gain: 3.25 × 40 = 130 tC/ha
  Total removed: 32.5 × 2 = 65 tC/ha
  Net accumulation: 65 tC/ha
  Average annual: 1.63 tC/ha/yr
```

However, Tier 2 data may report longer rotations, such as from 20-year coffee systems farming records.

### Tracking Overlapping Management Activities

Problem: Multiple improvements on same land (e.g., tillage change + lime + manure)

SOC Decision Framework:

Case A: Separable Impacts (Different Pools)

```         
Activity 1: No-till (affects 0-30cm mineral SOC) → F_MG = 1.10
Activity 2: Liming (affects inorganic C pool) → Report under Tier 3 inorganic C

Result: No double-counting; different carbon pools
```

Case B: Overlapping Impacts (Same Pool)

```         
Activity 1: Switch to no-till → F_MG = 1.10
Activity 2: Add cover crops → F_I = 1.04
Activity 3: Add manure → F_I = 1.11 (instead of 1.04)

Decision Options:
  Option 1 (if cumulative effect proven): F_MG × F_I = 1.10 × 1.11 = 1.22
  Option 2 (conservative): Use only F_I = 1.11 (most dominant factor)

Required: Document choice and scientific justification for VVB audit
```

::: callout-tip
## General Principle

When uncertain about cumulative versus saturating effects, apply the most conservative interpretation and document rationale clearly.

## 2.12 Uncertainty Quantification

### Error Propagation {.unnumbered}

For independent variables, total uncertainty is calculated as follows

$U_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(U_1)^2 + (U_2)^2 + \dots + (U_n)^2}$

Where U = proportional uncertainty (e.g., ±11% → 0.11)

Table 2.U: Typical Range in Uncertainty from Tier 1 Emission Factors

| Parameter | Source of Uncertainty | Typical Range | Impact on Credits |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| SOC~REF~ | Climate/soil classification ambiguity; spatial heterogeneity | ±5-90% | High—drives baseline calculation |
| F~MG~ (Improved Grassland) | Management definition; intensity measurement | ±9-11% | Moderate—multiplicative factor |
| F~I~ (High Input) | Quantification of organic matter additions | ±30% | Moderate—multiplicative factor |
| G (Agroforestry) | System definition; site variability; climate | ±13-63% | High—direct rate parameter |
| Biomass Stock | Remote sensing error; allometric equation selection | ±20-40% | High—one-time loss calculation |
| Activity Data (Area) | Land use classification; GPS accuracy | ±5-15% | Scales all estimates |

## 2.13 Worked Examples

Project: 1,000 ha improved silvopasture (F~MG~ = 1.17, F~I~ = 1.11, G = 3.07 tC/ha/yr)

Uncertainty Components:

```         
SOC_REF (LAC, Tropical Moist): ±5% → 0.05
F_MG (Improved Tropical): ±9% → 0.09
F_I (High Input): ±30% → 0.30
G (Silvopasture AGB): ±63% → 0.63
Area measurement: ±10% → 0.10

U_total = √[(0.05)² + (0.09)² + (0.30)² + (0.63)² + (0.10)²]
U_total = √[0.0025 + 0.0081 + 0.09 + 0.3969 + 0.01]
U_total = √0.5075 = 0.712 → ±71%
```

Credit Calculation with Uncertainty:

```         
Point Estimate: 18.5 tCO₂e/ha/yr × 1,000 ha = 18,500 tCO₂e/yr

Conservative Estimate (Lower Bound):
  18,500 × (1 - 0.712) = 5,328 tCO₂e/yr

Upper Bound:
  18,500 × (1 + 0.712) = 31,672 tCO₂e/yr

95% Confidence Interval: 5,328 - 31,672 tCO₂e/yr
```

## 2.14 Chapter Summary

The following were compiled as critical decision points for program proponents.

1.  Verify Soil Type First: Distinguish mineral vs. organic soils before selecting accounting method—this is the most fundamental decision

2.  Stratify Appropriately: Match climate zone, soil type, and management class to IPCC lookup tables—incorrect stratification invalidates results

3.  Document Baseline Rigorously: Large SOC or biomass changes require strong evidence of degraded initial conditions to justify additionality

4.  Apply Harvest Cycles: Agroforestry credits must account for periodic biomass removal—do not claim indefinite accumulation

5.  Implement Safeguards: Prevent double-counting through temporal tracking, pool separation, and conservative interpretation of overlapping activities

6.  Quantify Uncertainty: Calculate and report propagated uncertainties—consider Tier 2 upgrades when Tier 1 uncertainties exceed ±50%

ART-TREES Uncertainty Documentation:

1.  Quantified Uncertainty for each major parameter
2.  Propagated Total Uncertainty for final emission/removal estimates
3.  Documented Justification for Tier 2 or 3 Upgrade in support of variance requests

Table 2.V Emissions Factor Uncertainty Enhancements

| Rank | Conversion Activity | Carbon Benefit | Key Considerations |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Grassland Restoration (degraded \>\> improved) | 67% SOC increase | Requires documented degradation baseline |
| 2 | Silvoarable agroforestry establishment | 7.86 tC/ha/yr total gain | Needs strong silvicultural capacity |
| 3 | Young secondary forest conservation | 2.77-5.9 tC/ha/yr + avoided loss | High additionality, rapid credits |
| 4 | Multistrata coffee/cacao conversion | 4.05 tC/ha/yr + commodity income | Market-dependent feasibility |
| 5 | Conservation agriculture adoption | 22% SOC retention vs. tillage | Cumulative with other practices |

## 2.15 Next Steps

Practitioners should now be prepared to:

-   Select appropriate emission factors from IPCC 2019 Tier 1 values.
-   Calculate SOC and biomass changes using standardized equations
-   Identify strategic opportunities for credit generation
-   Implement MRV safeguards to improve compliance and reduce audit risk

Pending this review, we will proceed to Chapter 3 on Activity Data Uncertainty to address spatial and landcover classification errors
