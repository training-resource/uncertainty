    "text": "Overview\nThis resource provides methodological guidance for quantifying, reporting, and reducing uncertainty in REDD+ carbon accounting under IPCC 2019 Refinements and ART-TREES Standard V2.0 (ART, 2021; IPCC, 2019). Rather than viewing uncertainty as merely a penalty, this framework treats it as a strategic tool for identifying dominant error sources and optimizing credit issuance (Camara et al., 2024; Duncanson et al., 2021; Simoes et al., 2021).\nProjects investing in targeted uncertainty reduction can achieve 5-15% more credits through reduced deductions, premium pricing from enhanced credibility, lower verification costs, and methodological improvements. However, monitoring costs must be weighed against credit value (Köhler & Huth, 2010).\nCurrent State of Practice\nState-of-the-art evaluations reveal systematic gaps in how REDD+ countries quantify and report uncertainty. While 91% of participating countries report activity data uncertainty, only 4-14% report emission factor uncertainty and allometric uncertainty (Butler et al., 2024). This asymmetry does not reflect the actual relative importance of these sources. Research has demonstrated that methodological choices in emission factors and modelling assumptions can produce emission flux variations ranging from 4.2% to 262.2% of reference levels (J. Pelletier et al., 2013). Rather than technical limitations alone, such selective reporting reveals a worrying misalignment between rigor and financial incentives in results-based payment systems.\nThe Perverse Incentive\nButler et al. (2024) described this critical policy failure of selective uncertainty reporting as a kind of perverse incentive: “Because uncertainty factors into the payments made, there is a perverse incentive for countries to omit or underestimate sources of uncertainty. Including more sources of uncertainty makes the confidence intervals wider, giving a false impression that the quality of the estimates is worse.” This creates a troubling paradox where comprehensive uncertainty assessment, the hallmark of rigorous science, leads to wider confidence intervals and consequently lower payments, while incomplete uncertainty assessment produces narrower confidence intervals and higher payments. Countries are effectively penalized for methodological rigor and transparency, incentivizing selective reporting that undermines the environmental integrity of the entire REDD+ framework.\nRecognizing this fundamental design flaw, some results-based payment programs have implemented mitigation strategies to realign incentives. The FCPF Carbon Fund cap uncertainty deductions at a maximum threshold to limit incentive to underreport. This cap removes the direct penalty for comprehensive reporting while maintaining pressure to reduce actual uncertainty over time. Additionally, programs such as the ART-TREES registry reward demonstrable improvements by allowing participants to recover over-deducted credits when cumulative uncertainty decreases across multi-year crediting periods, creating positive incentives for methodological refinement.",

    "section": "Uncertainty Drivers",
    "text": "Uncertainty Drivers\nThis guide addresses the dominant sources of uncertainty in REDD+ carbon accounting, organized by typical magnitude of contribution to total variance:\nChapter 1: Allometry\nAllometric models are a critical and pervasive source of systematic bias, so much so that some call for a concerted global effort to improve allometric equations for tropical forests (J. Pelletier et al., 2013). Unlike random measurement errors, allometric uncertainty is systematic, meaning it cannot be reduced by simply measuring more trees. It also geographically variable, as equations developed in one tropical region often introduce substantial bias when applied elsewhere.\nWhile the ART-TREES Standard V2.0 exempts structural allometric uncertainty when models are applied consistently between baseline and crediting periods, recognizing that biases cancel through differencing, this pragmatic provision reduces reporting burden but does not eliminate actual uncertainty. This is particularly important if forest composition shifts over time due to selective logging, natural succession, or climate-driven changes. Chapter 1 provides methods for quantifying allometric uncertainty, developing region-specific equations, and determining when the consistency exemption applies.\nBiomass estimation depends on allometric equations relating tree diameter to aboveground biomass. Uncertainty sources include:\nModel selection:\n\nGeographic transferability of published equations\nSpecies-specific vs. generic models\nDiameter range extrapolation beyond calibration data\n\nParameter estimation:\n\nRegression coefficient standard errors\nResidual variance and heteroscedasticity\nSample size limitations in calibration datasets (Duncanson et al., 2015; Roxburgh et al., 2015).\n\nMeasurement error:\n\nDBH measurement precision (±0.5-1.0 cm)\nHeight measurement bias (clinometer/laser)\nWood density and debris variance(Yanai et al., 2010)\n\n\nBias correction:\n\nMaximum Likelihood Ratio (MLR) bias correction\nRestricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) bias correction\nBaskerville bias correction (Baskerville, 1972; Clifford et al., 2013)\n\nSpecies-specific height correction (Andersen et al., 2006; St-Onge et al., 2004)\n\nMoisture content correction factors (Roxburgh et al., 2015)\n\nNon-linear and intercept-only model prediction intervals.\nCensored data and zero-inflation bootstrapping\n\nKey methods: Monte Carlo parameter resampling (McRoberts & Westfall, 2016), prediction interval calculation, equivalence testing and cross-validation for model selection (Ploton et al., 2020), destructive sampling campaigns when cost-effective.\nART-TREES exemption: Structural uncertainty in allometric models excluded when applied consistently in baseline and crediting periods, reducing burden on project developers but not eliminating actual uncertainty.\nStrategic importance: Under-reported (only 4-14% of countries) but potentially dominant source once quantified (Butler et al., 2024).\nChapter 2: Emission Factor\nEmission factors represent a critical but dramatically under-reported source of uncertainty in REDD+ accounting. J. Pelletier et al. (2013) distinguish between “recurring sources” of random and systematic measurement errors quantified in each monitoring cycle and “modelling sources” of uncertainties embedded in model parameters and assumptions such as combustion completeness factors and gas-specific emission ratios. Their Panama case study demonstrates that “the highest error propagated using Monte Carlo simulations was caused by modelling sources of uncertainty,” including critical assumptions about fuel consumption rates, fire intensity classifications, and the relationships between modified combustion efficiency and trace gas production.\nChapter 2 addresses both the direct measurement uncertainty in emission factors (Gef) and the related uncertainty in combustion completeness (Cf), providing field protocols for jurisdictional campaigns and guidance on when IPCC Tier 1 defaults are sufficient versus when Tier 2 country-specific measurements justify their cost.\nEmission factors (Gef) convert biomass change to greenhouse gas emissions. Uncertainty sources include:\nDefault variance values:\n\nIPCC Table 2.5 confidence intervals (±30-50%)\nBiome-specific vs. generic factors\nFire type stratification (forest/savanna/peatland)\n\nCombustion completeness:\n\nFuel consumption factor (Cf) variability\nSeasonal and climatic effects\nFire intensity and duration\n\nGas-specific factors:\n\nCH₄: ±30-40% (incomplete combustion variability)\nN₂O: ±50-60% (nitrogen content and temperature effects)\nCO₂: ±5% for organic soils (stoichiometric, low variance)\n\nKey methods: Literature synthesis of emission factor ranges, field measurements of combustion products, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) for gas ratios.\nStrategic focus: Emission factors contribute 20-30% of total uncertainty but are expensive to reduce through field campaigns. Cost-benefit analysis favors using IPCC defaults unless jurisdiction-specific factors demonstrate substantially lower uncertainty (Köhler & Huth, 2010).\nChapter 3: Activity Data\nActivity data has historically received the most attention in REDD+ uncertainty analysis, with 91% of countries now reporting uncertainty in their land-use change estimates (Butler et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2015; Sheng et al., 2018). This focus has made activity data the best-quantified component through sustained investment in improved remote sensing protocols, validation frameworks, and change detection algorithms. However, this apparent success raises an important paradox: while activity data uncertainty has been systematically reduced and documented, other potentially dominant sources, particularly modelling assumptions about forest classification, carbon accumulation rates, and transition probabilities between land-use categories, remain largely under-estimated.\nJ. Pelletier et al. (2013) identify these modelling sources as exhibiting the highest sensitivity in their Panama analysis, with assumptions about fallow forest classification between intact and degraded forest, and temporal dynamics of regrowth producing emission flux variations ranging from 4.2% to 262.2% of reference levels. Chapter 3 addresses both the well-established methods for quantifying map accuracy uncertainty and the emerging need to characterize uncertainty in the modelling assumptions that link activity data to carbon stock changes.\nActivity data (A) represents the spatial extent and temporal dynamics of forest change. Uncertainty sources include:\nLand cover classification:\n\nProducer’s/User’s accuracy from confusion matrices\nMixed pixel effects at forest boundaries\nTemporal consistency in multi-date classifications\n\nChange detection:\n\nOmission errors (missed deforestation/degradation)\nCommission errors (false change detection)\nMinimum mapping unit effects\n\nSpatial aggregation:\n\nEdge effects and boundary uncertainty\nProjection and coordinate system errors\nPixel area calculation variance\nScale dependency: Köhler & Huth (2010) demonstrate 20-40% uncertainty at 1-ha scale vs. &gt;100% at 0.04-ha scale\n\nKey methods: Monte Carlo simulation of LULC classification, bootstrapping confusion matrices, spatial autocorrelation analysis, cross-validation with independent reference data.\nART-TREES requirements: Activity data uncertainty typically dominates reported uncertainty (40-60% contribution when emission factors omitted), but may not dominate actual total uncertainty once all sources quantified (Butler et al., 2024).\nChapter 4: Aggregated Simulation\nThis chapter Iintegrates previous sources through Monte Carlo simulation, the gold standard for REDD+ uncertainty quantification validated by 16+ peer-reviewed studies (Winrock 2025 literature review). Distinguishes “modelling sources” vs. “recurring sources” following N. Pelletier et al. (2024) framework.\nTotal uncertainty combines individual components through error propagation, with sensitivity analysis identifying highest-impact parameters for targeted reduction. Real-world implementation from Guyana TREES program demonstrates 21-percentage-point uncertainty reduction through methodological refinements.\nMonte Carlo Best Practices\nRecent literature review (Winrock 2025) spanning 2003-2023 confirms Monte Carlo Approach 2 as convergent standard:\n\n16 peer-reviewed studies validate effectiveness\nPlot to national scale applications demonstrated\nART-TREES requirement: n=10,000 iterations, 90% CI\nIPCC endorsed: 2006 and 2019 Refinement guidelines\n\nCritical Insights\n\nCorrelations essential: Ignoring interdependencies underestimates uncertainty 15-30% (Keller et al., 2001; Yanai et al., 2010)\n\nDistribution selection matters: Beta/log-normal &gt; truncated normal for bounded parameters (Picard et al., 2015)\n\nBootstrap required: When theoretical distributions unknown (Molto et al., 2013)\n\nSensitivity analysis guides investment: Sobol indices identify high-impact targets (Chen et al., 2015; Holdaway et al., 2014)\n\n\nIPCC Error Propagation\nComplete framework for multiplicative emission chain:\n\\[\nU_{total}^2 = U_A^2 + U_{EF}^2 + U_{biomass}^2 + 2 \\times \\text{Cov}(A, EF)\n\\]\nFor emissions E = A × MB × Cf × Gef:\n\\[\n\\frac{U_E^2}{E^2} = \\frac{U_A^2}{A^2} + \\frac{U_{M_B}^2}{M_B^2} + \\frac{U_{C_f}^2}{C_f^2} + \\frac{U_{G_{ef}}^2}{G_{ef}^2} + 2\\rho_{A,M_B}\\frac{U_A U_{M_B}}{A M_B}\n\\]\nKey insight: Relative uncertainties combine in quadrature for multiplicative models; correlations critical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndersen, H.-E., Reutebuch, S.

Log-transformation reduces RMSE to &lt;10%, cutting deductions to &lt;5%—the difference between project viability and failure.\n\n1.5.1 The Mathematical Problem\nAllometric relationships follow a power law, not linear relationship:\n\\[AGB = \\alpha \\times DBH^{\\beta}\\]\nWhere β typically ranges from 2.3-2.7, meaning biomass scales with DBH raised to a power. Attempting to fit this with linear regression (AGB = a + b * DBH) fundamentally misspecifies the functional form.\nConsequences of linear misspecification:\n\nMassive prediction errors: RMSE of 200-300 kg for trees where true AGB is 100 kg (200-300% relative error)\nSystematic bias: Underestimates large trees, overestimates small trees\nInflated uncertainty: Cannot capture exponential growth pattern, forcing residuals into noise\nHeteroscedasticity: Variance explodes at large diameters\n\n1.5.2 The Log-Transformation Solution\nTaking logarithms linearizes the power-law relationship:\n\\[\\ln(AGB) = \\ln(\\alpha) + \\beta \\times \\ln(DBH) + \\epsilon\\]\nThis transformation:\n\nConverts power law to linear form (β becomes a slope coefficient)\nStabilizes variance across tree sizes (homoscedasticity)\nNormalizes residuals (satisfies OLS assumptions)\nReduces RMSE by 90-95% (from 200% to 5-10%)\n\nFinancial impact: A 1M tonne CO₂e project valued at $5M faces:\n\nUntransformed model: 50% uncertainty deduction = $2.5M loss\nLog-transformed model: 8% uncertainty deduction = $400k loss\nNet benefit: $2.1M additional revenue from proper transformation\n\n\n# Fit both models for comparison\nlinear_model &lt;- lm(agb ~ dbh, data = scbi_stem1)\nlog_model &lt;- lm(log(agb) ~ log(dbh), data = scbi_stem1)\n\n# Extract RMSE\nrmse_linear &lt;- sqrt(mean(residuals(linear_model)^2))\nrmse_log &lt;- sqrt(mean(residuals(log_model)^2))\n\n# Calculate relative RMSE\nmean_agb &lt;- mean(scbi_stem1$agb)\nrel_rmse_linear &lt;- (rmse_linear / mean_agb) * 100\nrel_rmse_log &lt;- (exp(rmse_log) - 1) * 100  # Back-transform log-scale RMSE\n\ncat(sprintf(\"Linear Model RMSE: %.1f kg (%.0f%%)\\n\", rmse_linear, rel_rmse_linear))\n## Linear Model RMSE: 210.5 kg (215%)\ncat(sprintf(\"Log-Transformed Model RMSE: %.2f on log-scale (%.1f%% relative)\\n\", \n            rmse_log, rel_rmse_log))\n## Log-Transformed Model RMSE: 0.19 on log-scale (20.5% relative)\ncat(sprintf(\"\\nUncertainty reduction: %.0f percentage points\\n\", \n            rel_rmse_linear - rel_rmse_log))\n## \n## Uncertainty reduction: 194 percentage points\n\nThis section sets up the critical justification for the cross-validation workflow in the next section, where we implement log-transformed models and quantify the uncertainty reduction that protects carbon revenues.\nAge / Diameter Classes\nStratification by size class or age cohort involves a critical component in forest biomass modeling. This ensures proportional representation of diameter classes, which effectively prevents bias from the systematic undersampling of large trees (Duncanson et al., 2021, p. 100; Paul et al., 2017).\n\n# Filter by adequate sample size (n ≥ 50)\nspecies_counts &lt;- scbi_stem1 |&gt;\n  dplyr::group_by(genus, species) |&gt;\n  dplyr::summarise(n = n(), .groups = 'drop') |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(n &gt;= 50)\ncat(\"Species meeting minimum sample (n ≥ 50):\\n\")\n## Species meeting minimum sample (n ≥ 50):\nprint(species_counts)\n## # A tibble: 7 × 3\n##   genus       species         n\n##   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n## 1 Amelanchier arborea       123\n## 2 Carpinus    caroliniana    57\n## 3 Carya       glabra         64\n## 4 Fraxinus    americana      52\n## 5 Hamamelis   virginiana    107\n## 6 Lindera     benzoin      1201\n## # ℹ 1 more row\n\n# Example: Liriodendron tulipifera (tulip poplar)\nlirio_data &lt;- scbi_stem1 |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(genus == \"Liriodendron\", species == \"tulipifera\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(!is.na(dbh), !is.na(agb))\ncat(sprintf(\"\\nLiriodendron tulipifera sample size: %d trees\\n\", nrow(lirio_data)))\n## \n## Liriodendron tulipifera sample size: 17 trees\ncat(sprintf(\"DBH range: %.1f - %.1f cm\\n\", min(lirio_data$dbh), max(lirio_data$dbh)))\n## DBH range: 5.4 - 74.8 cm\n\n# derive diameter class stratification\nlirio_data &lt;- lirio_data |&gt; dplyr::mutate(dbh_class = cut(dbh, \n    breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100),\n    labels = c(\"0-10\", \"10-20\", \"20-30\", \"30-40\", \"40-50\", \"&gt;50\"))\n    )\n\n# Check distribution across size classes\nsize_distribution &lt;- lirio_data |&gt;\n  dplyr::group_by(dbh_class) |&gt;\n  dplyr::summarise(n = n(),\n    mean_dbh = mean(dbh),\n    mean_agb = mean(agb),\n    total_biomass_pct = sum(agb) / sum(lirio_data$agb) * 100,\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\nprint(size_distribution)\n## # A tibble: 6 × 5\n##   dbh_class     n mean_dbh mean_agb total_biomass_pct\n##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 0-10          2     6.58     13.6             0.118\n## 2 10-20         2    12.6      60.4             0.526\n## 3 20-30         3    24.4     294.              3.84 \n## 4 30-40         3    35.7     721.              9.42 \n## 5 40-50         1    43.5    1135.              4.94 \n## 6 &gt;50           6    66.1    3105.             81.2\n\n# Stratified split: 80% calibration, 20% validation\n# Maintain proportional representation across classes\ntrain_idx &lt;- lirio_data |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(row_id = row_number()) |&gt; \n    dplyr::group_by(dbh_class) |&gt;\n  dplyr::slice_sample(prop = 0.8) |&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(row_id)\n\ncalibration_data &lt;- lirio_data[train_idx, ]\nvalidation_data &lt;- lirio_data[-train_idx, ]\n\n# Verify size structure is preserved\ncat(\"\\nCalibration set size distribution:\\n\")\n## \n## Calibration set size distribution:\nprint(table(calibration_data$dbh_class))\n## \n##  0-10 10-20 20-30 30-40 40-50   &gt;50 \n##     1     1     2     2     0     4\ncat(\"\\nValidation set size distribution:\\n\")\n## \n## Validation set size distribution:\nprint(table(validation_data$dbh_class))\n## \n##  0-10 10-20 20-30 30-40 40-50   &gt;50 \n##     1     1     1     1     1     2",

It’s important to be aware that if you’re working with a large dataset or numerous resampling iterations, the resulting train() object may grow significantly in size. This happens because caret must store a record of every row, including both the observed values and predictions, for each resampling iteration. By visualizing the results, we can offer insights into the performance of our model on the resampled data.\n\n# Extract cross-validated predictions\ncv_predictions &lt;- lm_monte_carlo$pred\n\n# Calculate metrics\nrmse_cv &lt;- sqrt(mean((cv_predictions$pred - cv_predictions$obs)^2))\nmae_cv &lt;- mean(abs(cv_predictions$pred - cv_predictions$obs))\nr2_cv &lt;- cor(cv_predictions$pred, cv_predictions$obs)^2\nhead(cv_predictions)\n\n\n\n\nintercept\npred\nobs\nrowIndex\nResample\n\n\n\nTRUE\n-0.595\n-0.573\n6\nResample01\n\n\nTRUE\n0.453\n0.535\n14\nResample01\n\n\nTRUE\n5.106\n5.085\n20\nResample01\n\n\nTRUE\n7.055\n7.145\n31\nResample01\n\n\nTRUE\n0.106\n0.128\n35\nResample01\n\n\nTRUE\n0.587\n0.638\n42\nResample01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Display metrics\ncat(\"\\nCross-Validation Results:\\n\")\n## \n## Cross-Validation Results:\ncat(strrep(\"=\", 50), \"\\n\", sep = \"\")\n## ==================================================\ncat(sprintf(\"RMSE: %.2f kg\\n\", rmse_cv))\n## RMSE: 0.07 kg\ncat(sprintf(\"MAE: %.2f kg\\n\", mae_cv))\n## MAE: 0.04 kg\ncat(sprintf(\"R²: %.4f\\n\", r2_cv))\n## R²: 0.9993\ncat(strrep(\"=\", 50), \"\\n\", sep = \"\")\n## ==================================================\n\n# Visualize\nggplot(cv_predictions, aes(x = pred, y = obs)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, shape = 1) + \n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = 'blue', linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = TRUE) +\n  coord_fixed() + labs(title = \"Cross-Validated Predictions\", subtitle = sprintf(\n    \"RMSE = %.1f kg | R² = %.3f | n = %d\", rmse_cv, r2_cv, nrow(cv_predictions)),\n    x = \"Predicted AGB (kg)\", y = \"Observed AGB (kg)\") + theme_minimal()",

Using IPCC defaults (±30%) is often more cost-effective than reducing uncertainty to ±15% at high cost.\n\n2.2.3 N2O Emissions:\nN2O production depends on:\n\nNitrogen content of fuel: Varies by vegetation type\n\nLegume-rich forests: 1.5-2.5% N\nNon-legume forests: 0.5-1.0% N\nGrasses/savanna: 0.8-1.5% N\n\n\nCombustion temperature:\n\nLow temp (200-400°C): Incomplete N oxidation → More N2O\nHigh temp (800-1200°C): Complete oxidation → NOx, less N2O\n\n\nSoil nitrogen:\n\nSmoldering fires heat soil → Release soil N as N2O\nCan double total N2O emissions vs. aboveground only\n\n\n\nIPCC default uncertainty: ±65% (highest of all major gases)\nStrategic assessment: Despite high uncertainty (±65%), N2O contributes only 0.3-0.5% of total CO2e. Not a priority for uncertainty reduction unless:\n\nPeatland fires (soil contribution large)\nLegume-dominated forests (high N content)\nPolicy focus on non-CO2 gases",

    "section": "\n2.6 Notes on Next Steps",
    "text": "2.6 Notes on Next Steps\n\n2.6.1 Summary Findings\n1. Under-reporting is widespread: Only 4-14% of REDD+ countries report emission factor uncertainty (Butler et al. 2024), despite ±30-50% contribution to total uncertainty.\n2. Combustion factor dominates: Field measurements show Cf contributes 60-70% of emission factor variance—more important than gas-specific emission factors.\n3. CO2 is not a priority: Low uncertainty (±4.4%) and large contribution (98%) mean little room for improvement. Focus on CH4 and Cf.\n4. N2O is high uncertainty but low impact: ±65% uncertainty but only 0.3-0.5% of total CO2e. Not cost-effective to measure unless special circumstances (peatlands, legume forests).\n5. Tier 2 is cost-effective above 80,000 t CO2e: Field campaigns ($75k) break even when annual fire emissions exceed ~5% of total jurisdiction emissions.\n\n2.6.2 Investment Framework\nFor jurisdictions with LOW fire emissions (&lt;5% of total):\nUse IPCC Tier 1 defaults\n\nCost: $0 - Uncertainty: ±30-50%\nRationale: Fire emissions too small to justify Tier 2 investment\n\nFor jurisdictions with MODERATE fire emissions (5-20% of total):\nInvest in combustion factor measurements:\n\nCost: $20-40k (ground-based only)\nUncertainty reduction: 30-50% → 20-25%\nRationale: Greatest uncertainty reduction per dollar spent\n\nFor jurisdictions with HIGH fire emissions (&gt;20% of total):\n\nFull Tier 2 campaign (FTIR + combustion factor) - Cost: $75-100k\nUncertainty reduction: 30-50% → 15-20%\nROI: 1,500-2,000% for typical jurisdiction\nRationale: Large emissions justify comprehensive measurement\n\n2.6.3 Technical Recommendations\n1. Prioritize combustion factor measurements:\n\nAccounts for 60-70% of emission factor variance\nRelatively inexpensive ($20-40k ground-based)\nJurisdiction-specific (IPCC defaults may not apply)\n\n2. Use IPCC defaults for gas-specific emission factors:\n\nCost of field measurement ($50-100k) rarely justified\nIPCC defaults adequate for most applications\nException: Peatland fires (require Tier 2)\n\n3. Implement Monte Carlo simulation:\n\nRequired by ART-TREES (n=10,000)\nCaptures non-linear error propagation\nSoftware available (R, Python, (RISK?) Excel)\n\n4. Stratify by vegetation type:\n\nForest fires ≠ savanna fires (different Cf)\nSeparate assessment for each major type\nWeighted average for reporting\n\n2.6.4 Next Chapter\nChapter 4: Aggregated Uncertainty will integrate:\n\nActivity data (Chapter 3, Activity Data ebook)\nAllometry/biomass (Chapter 1, this ebook)\nEmission factors (Chapter 2, this chapter)\n\nCritical linkage: Total uncertainty combines all sources:\n\\[\nU_{total}^2 = U_A^2 + U_{biomass}^2 + U_{EF}^2 + 2\\rho_{AB}U_A U_{biomass}\n\\]\nCovariance terms: Activity data and biomass may be correlated (same field plots), requiring careful treatment in aggregation.\nSensitivity analysis: Chapter 4 will identify which components contribute most to total uncertainty, guiding strategic investment priorities.",
